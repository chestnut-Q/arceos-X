# RUN
```shell
make A=apps/task/sched_static ARCH=riscv64 PLATFORM=riscv64-qemu-virt LOG=info run

## Using multicore
```shell
make A=apps/task/sched_static LOG=info SMP=3 run
```

# RESULT
```

# PROCESS

### 设计思路：

有三个任务 {τ1, τ2, τ3}

任务属性如下：

任务 τ1：执行时间 C1 = 1, 周期 T1 = 3
任务 τ2：执行时间 C2 = 2, 周期 T2 = 5
任务 τ3：执行时间 C3 = 1, 周期 T3 = 6

这里使用一定时间的循环来模拟这个执行时间。
